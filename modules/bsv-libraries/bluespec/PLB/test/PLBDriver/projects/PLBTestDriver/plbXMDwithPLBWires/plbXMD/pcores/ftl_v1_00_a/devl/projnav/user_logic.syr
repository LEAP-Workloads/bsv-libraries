INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <State> of Case statement line 332 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:

   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
